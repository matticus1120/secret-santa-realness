# Secret Santa Realness

Secret Santa Realness is a single-page application built with React. Screenshare on the TV for your office of family Christmas party gift exchange, enter the names all those participating, and find out all the winners one by one, with custom name-specific Gifs provided by the Giphy API. (and some optional cheezy background music). 

The mind-child of some talented folks at [Blackjet](http://blackjet.ca/).
